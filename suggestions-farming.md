# Suggestions on Farming

Ideas on game improvement from players of Art of War:Legion.

## Reducing 3-star requirement

[Suggestion by DOM FlyBG](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/932344776643182663)
> Lower needed requirements for getting 3 star win, from 50% troops to 20%;

## Assist feature

[Suggestion by 𝓚𝓲𝓽𝓼𝓾𝓷𝓮#0429](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/878806641577967647)
> Make farming easier by allowing players to use Assist in main levels.
> 
> - Tap the hero to reveal the “Upgrade, Replace, Assist” menu
> - Choose “Assist” and select a support hero
> - The support hero’s passive is skill is active if the field hero is alive (no hero, no assist)
> - Main level only. Not available in Head Hunts because dev put weird events in “Head Hunts” and we don’t want any confusion over what Head Hunt is a Head Hunt
> - Remove coin drop bonus from Jinn so we don’t have any confusion over stacking. Add back his passive skill of damage reduction from skills.

## ✅Better matchmaking system

Thank you for your suggestion. We have already made some adjustments to
the matchmaking mechanism, and we are keeping working on its optimization.

## Use Hohenheim's coin drop skill without using the hero

[Suggestion by Pompatous](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/931628565886296116)
> Making farming easier for us and more profitable for you,
> by making Hohenheim's coin skill active even if he's not
> in the battle. We can test our formations with our main
> heroes but still get our Hohenheim rewards for getting three stars.
> You get more revenue as we watch more videos.

## 👍Separate farming mode

[Suggestion by RA SrtaJaky🇧🇷#1809](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/928622172782624780)
> The current stage 8000 is great for testing your opponents' defenses.
> But it greatly increases the cultivation time in the game.
> My suggestion would be to implement a button where the player could choose
> between the current stage 8000 mode and a farming mode.
>
> In Farming Mode players would battle against Headhunt-like formations or
> other types of formations that are easy to take down.
> All other features like Midas, x2 bonuses and Ads would remain as they are today.

Hello! Your suggestion is really good, we will consider adding something
like this to level 8000. The idea is quite interesting.
