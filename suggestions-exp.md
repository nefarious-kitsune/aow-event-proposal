> My suggestion is that you all finally add new levels in the growth funds for
> gems, medals, and coins. The levels have increments of 5 early on and then
> change to 10s. I'd like for 55, 65, 75, 85, and 95 added please.

## Exp for temple of fusion

[Suggestion by Scythe](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/930804063484903465)
> Receiving the troop from temple of fusion does not give the XP for it.
> Please make this possible after receiving the troop from temple of
> fusion to get a proper [experience](quests/exp-quests) for it


## 👍Exp for dust wheel

[Suggestion by adam667220#5755](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/924311669369348117)
> Please consider giving some amount of EXP when hero shards are spent
> on the dust wheel. We don't receive EXP when they are received because
> it would occur upon leveling up. However, for 15+ rare and epic heros
> or shards that are used exclusively for dust, we never receive any form
> of EXP despite having accrued hundreds of shards.
