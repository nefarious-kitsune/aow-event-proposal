> Since a lot of players (both f2p and p2w) are interested in owning skins
> they missed out on in the past, but aren't interested in spending 50k gems
> in the mystic store or money, how about you just organize a spending event
> where the final prize is a skin of our own choosing out of the available
> skins? That way a lot of players will actually be able to get that skin they've been craving for so long...

Thank you for your valuable suggestion, William! We will consider it and
think about how to make skins more available, useful, and will develop
this interesting part of the gameplay.
