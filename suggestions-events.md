Thank you for your suggestion. Let players understand our game better is
also one of the things we have been working hard on. Your suggestion
coincides with our plan. We already have begun the works, and will announce
it when it’s ready.

Hello, we are glad to receive more feedback from you. Back then,
we evaluated the player’s feedback and data that we gathered from
the usage of the wheel, and it did not show the results that we hoped for.
Thus we have decided to stop the testing of the Clan Wheen and remove it.

We will use other ways to help you get your favorite heroes!

Thank you for your suggestion. We are working on more ways and extra
events for you to get the HH medals. We are not going to add them to
the wheel, but we will make sure you get enough medals.

<blockquote style="color:#b93a35">
Thank you for your suggestion, till now we've had some events that added
more heroes to the packs. We will consider adding new heroes to Super Card
Pack and Deluxe Card Pack. But we have to be aware that adding them will
lower the probability for every hero to be drawn.</blockquote>

Thank you for your suggestion. It sounds like a very good idea.
We have been discussing it. It takes time to develop such a feature,
so it may not be released very soon. But we will make this kind of
feature in the future.</blockquote>
