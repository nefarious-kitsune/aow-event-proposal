Thank you for your suggestion. Let players understand our game better is
also one of the things we have been working hard on. Your suggestion
coincides with our plan. We already have begun the works, and will announce
it when it’s ready.

Thank you for your suggestion, till now we've had some events that added
more heroes to the packs. We will consider adding new heroes to Super Card
Pack and Deluxe Card Pack. But we have to be aware that adding them will
lower the probability for every hero to be drawn.</blockquote>
