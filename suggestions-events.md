Thank you for your suggestion. Let players understand our game better is

it when it’s ready.

Thank you for your suggestion. We are working on more ways and extra
events for you to get the HH medals. We are not going to add them to
the wheel, but we will make sure you get enough medals.

<blockquote style="color:#b93a35">
Thank you for your suggestion, till now we've had some events that added
more heroes to the packs. We will consider adding new heroes to Super Card
Pack and Deluxe Card Pack. But we have to be aware that adding them will
lower the probability for every hero to be drawn.</blockquote>
