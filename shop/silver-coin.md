# Silver Coins

Guild members can earn silver coins by contributing to [Guild Quests](../quests/guild-quests)

Guild members should earn silver coins according to the following:

```
100 × Quantity × Total_Guild_Point ÷ Total_Quantity
```

# Examples

**Example 1**. Let's say the following quests worth 720 Guild Points:

> Obtain 240 Epic cards from the Temple of Fusion

Then, when a member obtains *5* Epic troops from Temple of Fusion,
the member earns *1500* silver coins (`100 × 5 × 720 ÷ 240)`.

----

**Example 2**. Let's say the following quests worth 4000 Guild Points:

> Win players that are not in your clan in the Arena with 300,000 Legendary battle units.

Then, when a member uses *14* Legendary battle units in an Arena battle and wins,
the member earns *14* silver coins (`100 × 14 × 3000 ÷ 30000)`.

If the member does 20 battles every day, then the member may earn *3920* silver coins per season.

----

**Example 2**. Let's say the following quests worth 1200 Guild Points:

> Use Sacred Swordsman troops to battle 4000 times against others that are not in your own clans.

Then, when a member uses Sacred Swordsman units in an Arena battle,
the member earns *3* silver coins (`100 × 1 × 1200 ÷ 4000)`.

If the member does 20 battles every day, then the member may earn *420* silver coins per season.
