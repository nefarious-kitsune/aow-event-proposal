# Problems

Players want to exchange resources with clan mates

## Suggested Solution

- In the [Guild shop](guild-shop), create a Donation Box
- Guild members can donate troops to the Donation Box
- Guild members can claim troops to the Donation Box

## Issues and Abuses

**Issue**: *This may create imbalance because privileged players
can earn game items for free*

**Solution**: Require guild members to work hard and __earn__ the items.
Require guild members to complete Guild Quests to earn
[Silver Coins](silver-coin) which they can use to purchase donated
items in the Guild Shop.

---

**Issue**: *This may lead to disruption from guild hoppers looking for bargains.*

**Solution**: 1. Guild members cannot purchase items in Guild Shop for the
first 7 days after joining a guild. 2. Guild quest credit (Silver Coins) do
not carry over. When a player change guild, the player's guild credit reset
and the player must earn the credit in the new guild.

---

**Issue**: *This may lead to off-game transaction abuse where players
sell valuable items for money or cryptocurrency.*

**Solution**: Require a cool-down period. Donated items must be on display
for a few days before any any member can purchase the item.

---

**Issue**: *This may lead to guild drama where two members agree to
some troops donation and a third member "intercept" the donation.*

**Solution**: Make all donation and purchase anonymous.

---

**Issue**: *A rouge guild member may flood the Donation Box with useless
items that nobody wants and cannot remove from the box.*

**Solution**: Create a time-limit so that unclaimed items will expire after
several days and be removed from the shelf.

---

**Issue**: *A rouge guild members may purchase everything in the Donation
Box and prevent any other member from making any purchase.*

**Solution**: Limit how many purchases a player can make in a single day or
in a season.

---

**Issue**: *Small, independent guild cannot survive because they have fewer
members and hence a smaller pool for donation.*

**Solution**: No solution what-so-ever.

---

**Issue**: *A Guild that plays fair will always have an empty Donation Box.*
Most guilds assign members according to their arena ranks. So in any in-game
guild, the members are usually in the same economic predicament - they all
need the same things other members need (and don't need the same things other
members do not need).

**Solution**: No solution what-so-ever

---

**Issue**: *Some players will abuse the system by creating many alt accounts
and use the easy gems in first 8000 levels to obtain valuable resources and
transfer to their main accounts.*

**Solution**: Require a shelving fee. A guild member must also pay
[Silver Coins](silver-coin) to donate an item. This makes it difficult for
alt accounts to donate items.

---

**Issue**: *Shelving fee will discourage donation.*

**Solution**: No solution what-so-ever

---

**Issue**: *Large guilds may abuse the system by using accounts from
retired players to gift themselves highly valuable items. And since the
accounts are high-developed, the accounts would have little problem earning
silver coins.*

**Solution**: No solution what-so-ever

---

**Issue**: *Most players play fair and will not understand the many
restrictions put in place to prevent abuses, and some players will
find creative ways to get around all the restrictions described above.*

**Solution**: No solution what-so-ever

---

**Issue**: *Exchange and donation will not fix game economy.*

**Solution**: Of course not.


## Conclusion

Exchanging and donating items will create more problems than it can solve
and therefore should **NOT** be implemented.

A better solution is a simple [Guild shop](guild-shop) where the developer
dictate what are purchaseable and at what prices.
