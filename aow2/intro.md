# Arena

(12-Day Event)

Every season, the bravest commanders compete in the arena in one-on-one battles, and only the strongest may raise to challenge the Titans.

# Titan War

(2-Day Event)

The top 120 commanders will battle the Titans at the portal. The commanders must *work together* to defeat the powerful enemy.

- The commanders will be randomly assigned in group of 3.
- The commanders of each group must work together to defeat the enemy.
- The commanders will be randomly assigned a turn number.
- The commanders will attack in the order according to their turn number.
- On day 1, the commanders set their attack formation.
- On day 2, the commanders attack.
- The commanders will be able to see attack formation of their partners.
- The commanders must fight strategically (example: on turn 1, focus heavily on back attackers to take out enemy's back defense, on turn 2, focus heavily on melee attack to destroy enemy's front line tanks, and on turn 3, use extreme speed to quickly overwhelm enemy's long-range troops in the middle.)
- This can potentially become an e-sport event where players watch the final showdown in live streams.
