Thank you for your suggestion. We have already paid attention to this problem,
and we will focus on solving it to make it easier for players to find suitable
opponents. We will consider doing it the way you suggested, or maybe will come
up with another way of implementation. But it is an issue we are paying
attention to.</blockquote>

## Reset time - Hold point gain from attack
[Suggestion by Jimbo#0102](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/928071211240554557)
> [Snip] The idea is you hold all attack gains of the current day, but
> you allow defensive wins and losses to show up in your score. Then
> after reset your previous days gains will be added into your score gradually
> throughout the day. Basically (0-24hr)/24 * attack gains. On the last day
> that days attack point would be added right at reset for the final score.
> Statistically this should eliminate almost all of the time of day attack
> advantages. The only reset advantage issue remaining would be having the
> option to use gem attacks at the last minute if you see your score is below
> a GOW threshold. Which they could fix with a setting that only charges and
> adds the points from the gem attacks if you need them.

Thank you for your suggestion. We have also focused on the time zone issue
and on how we can solve it. We know that it brings inconvenience to some
of our players, and we would like to avoid that. We will keep testing more
options and possible solutions. If we come up with a reasonable solution
and confirm it, it will be announced to you and other players. Thank you!
