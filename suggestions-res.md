Thank you for your suggestion, till now we've had some events that added
more heroes to the packs. We will consider adding new heroes to Super Card
Pack and Deluxe Card Pack. But we have to be aware that adding them will
lower the probability for every hero to be drawn.</blockquote>

existing in-game economy, so temporarily we have no plans to implement
such big changes or adjustments.
