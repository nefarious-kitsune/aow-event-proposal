## Hold point gain from attack
[Suggestion by Jimbo#0102](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/928071211240554557)
> [Snip] The idea is you hold all attack gains of the current day, but
> you allow defensive wins and losses to show up in your score. Then
> after reset your previous days gains will be added into your score gradually
> throughout the day. Basically (0-24hr)/24 * attack gains. On the last day
> that days attack point would be added right at reset for the final score.
> Statistically this should eliminate almost all of the time of day attack
> advantages. The only reset advantage issue remaining would be having the
> option to use gem attacks at the last minute if you see your score is below
> a GOW threshold. Which they could fix with a setting that only charges and
> adds the points from the gem attacks if you need them.
