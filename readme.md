
# New Event Proposal

This is a proposal for in-game special events that provide
challenges in a **story-telling** manner.

## The Academy

The Academy is a series of *permenant* tutorial events to walk beginner players through
the basics of the game.

#### Participation

* The events are unlocked after the player pass main level 1000, 2000, and 3000.
* The events are located in Headhunts after unlocked.
* The player may also enter the event via the Events icon on the Home page.
* The player can enter the event at any time.
* Once entered, the player has exactly 5 days (24 x 5 hours) to complete it.

### The Academy I

[The Academy](the-academy.md) (unlocked at level 1000) provides
training on basics of formation and the uses of basic troops
such as Archers, Ghost Assassins, and Goblikazes.

### The Academy II

The Academy II (unlocked at level 2000) provides
training on basics of Honor Hunting.

### The Academy III

The Academy III (unlocked at level 3000) provides

## Special Events

These are time-limited events that players can complete to win
new content, such as hero and troops.
