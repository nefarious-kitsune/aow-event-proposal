
# New Event Proposal

This is a proposal for in-game special events that provide
challenges in a **story-telling** manner.

## Permenant events

These are events that players can enter at any time.
Once entered, the player has exactly 5 days (24 x 5 hours) to complete it.

* [The Academy](the-academy.md) - a welcome event for new players (unlocks at level 1,000)
* The Academy II - event unlocks at level 2,000
* The Academy III - event unlocks at level 3,000

## Special events

These are time-limited events that players can complete to win
new content, such as hero and troops.

* [Davison](special-event-davison.md)
