Hello, after doing some testing, we have come to realize that adding more epic
cards will dilute the card pool even more and, as a result, it would lower the
chance to draw a specific card, so we did not add more epic cards to the
4-star draw. If players still want to add more cards, we will consider
expanding the card pool. But there are downsides to making this adjustment.

Thank you for your suggestions. It is an extreme situation that happens very,
very rarely. We are now considering making these adjustments, we will announce
it if the changes are made.
