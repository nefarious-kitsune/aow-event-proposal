Hello, after doing some testing, we have come to realize that adding more epic
cards will dilute the card pool even more and, as a result, it would lower the
chance to draw a specific card, so we did not add more epic cards to the
4-star draw. If players still want to add more cards, we will consider
expanding the card pool. But there are downsides to making this adjustment.

## 👍Temple of Fusion - Don't return troops that is already fused

[Suggestion by Kian Friden#1339](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/920131498802307112)

## 👍Temple of Fusion - fuse epic troops for epic troops

[Suggestion by Stan 🇧🇬#4900](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/914289990542970970)
> Will be really good if you allowed as to fuse Epic units to get Epic unit.
> So, in that situation the cost will drop. Same as fuse for Legendary units.
> And we must get some experience for fusing as well!

Thank you for your suggestion. Such changes will greatly affect the
in-game balance and economy. For now, we are not planning to make such changes.
