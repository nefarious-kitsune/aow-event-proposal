# Command Center

[The AoW Ideas project](https://github.com/nefarious-kitsune/aow.ideas):
*Ideas from AoW players on changes & improvements to help make the game more interesting.*

## Problem

The overall game UI is disorganized.

## Suggested Solution

* Create a unifying gaming experience
* Create Commander Center to consolidate some functions
* A **profile** tab for general information
* An **Inbox** tab for receiving messages *and* rewards
* A **Quests** tab for [EXP Quests](../quests/exp-quests) and [Achievements](../quests/achievements)
* A **Subscription** tab for managing subscriptions
* When entering the UI, the screen defaults to **Quests** tab (not Profile tab)
* Organize the tabs so Commander Center and Guild have consistency.
