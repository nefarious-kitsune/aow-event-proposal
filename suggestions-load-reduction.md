# Suggestions on Farming

Ideas on game improvement from players of Art of War:Legion.

## Gold Earning Tracking

* Let players track how much gold they earn each day.
* Create a new [Exp Quests](quests/exp-quests) such as "Earn 8M coin"
* The progress should count up even after the quest is completed.

> [snip] I would like to see a display of 'base gold' left before cap kicks in.
> Would really help know how far the daily farmers are down the line and
> how much they have to go before hiring the drop /cap.

> Perhaps in a battle report under the gold it could display xxx/6000000

## Make it easier to claim daily rewards

> [snip]
> 1. All daily rewards are sent to Inbox
> 2. We can receive messages from Clan General in Inbox
> 3. We can receive a message from Clan General if we are kicked out of a clan

## Make it easier to claim arena rewards

[Suggestion by Kitsune]()
> Make it easy to claim [arena](structure/arena) rewards by reusing the "purchase" button:
> 1. Green "$9.99": No rewards needs claiming. Battle Pass not purchased
> 2. Yellow "claim all": Some rewards needs claiming.
> 3. Disabled "claim all": No rewards needs claiming. Battle Pass already purchased

## Make some game activities optional

* Reduce gaming time and give players more control over how they spend the time
* Remove daily quests (move gem rewards to [log-in rewards](inbox/inbox)).
* Create **[Exp Quests](quests/exp-quests)** which serves as a *reminder* of things that most players do everyday.
