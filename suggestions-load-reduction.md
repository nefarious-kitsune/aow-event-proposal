# Suggestions on Farming

Ideas on game improvement from players of Art of War:Legion.

## Gold Earning Tracking

* Let players track how much gold they earn each day.
* Create a new [Exp Quests](quests/exp-quests) such as "Earn 8M coin"
* The progress should count up even after the quest is completed.

## Make it easier to claim daily rewards

[Suggestion by Kitsune](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/931034062473289830)
> [snip]
> 1. All daily rewards are sent to Inbox
> 2. We can receive messages from Clan General in Inbox
> 3. We can receive a message from Clan General if we are kicked out of a clan

## Make it easier to claim arena rewards

[Suggestion by Kitsune]()
> Make it easy to claim [arena](structure/arena) rewards by reusing the "purchase" button:
> 1. Green "$9.99": No rewards needs claiming. Battle Pass not purchased
> 2. Yellow "claim all": Some rewards needs claiming.
> 3. Disabled "claim all": No rewards needs claiming. Battle Pass already purchased

## Make some game activities optional

* Reduce gaming time and give players more control over how they spend the time
* Remove daily quests (move gem rewards to [log-in rewards](inbox/inbox)).
* Create **[Exp Quests](quests/exp-quests)** which serves as a *reminder* of things that most players do everyday.

> This game requires more and more time as more features keep getting
> added to it. It’s at a point where you need a good 2 hours to do IW,
> HT, HH x 2, and arena every single day. Add farming to that to get the
> necessary 100 stars and it’s going through the roof. My suggestion
> revolves around reducing the time needed to spend in order to do
> the absolutely required things every day. Not all of these need to
> be implemented, but I believe that reducing requirements even by a
> little will result in long term time savings for the players. Some
> suggestions to cater for this are:
> 
> 1. Reduce Honor Hunting and IW time from 5 minutes to 4 minutes per
> attempt. It’s a small reduction and it shouldn’t affect the rankings
> much, but it’s 6 minutes a day saved by players.
> 
> 2. Reduce the Head Hunt missions to half like you did last time
> when you took it down from 40 to 20. 10 of each are more than
> enough. Double the rewards like you did before so that players
>  don’t lose anything.
> 
> 3. For the arena and hero trials I actually have two different
> proposals. Option 1 is to reduce arena daily battles and reduce
> the reward required number of wins. Something like 15 a day without
> battle pass and 25 with battle pass shouldn’t affect the rankings
> much. Most top players have BP anyway and they won’t lose the 10
> extra battles a day so it should benefit them. Noobs like me that
> don’t buy BP will be at a slight disadvantage but the time savings
> should cover up for it. We can always spend the extra time to select
> a better opponent. Similarly, for HT, I’d reduce the daily battles
> from 10 to 8. Option 2 revolves around alternating the two. I
> don’t think that would fly as you recently changed HT to two weeks
> for that reason. But my suggestion is essentially to have only 1
> week of HT followed 1 week of arena battles. Nobody takes arena
> seriously the first week anyway. You could double the trophies
> earned/lost from today so that rankings are not heavily affected.
> I personally prefer option 2 but I’m sure it won’t fly.
> 
> 4. The fourth suggestion essentially revolves around allowing
> people to skip days without missing on the rewards. For instance,
> if I skip Honor Hunting for a day, allow me to do the 3 extra battles
> the next day. It wouldn’t benefit people to miss those days on purpose
> as bosses get tougher on the next day, but it wouldn’t punish them too
> hard if they missed a day. Don’t allow battles to be carried over for
> more than one day so you at least need to play every other day.
> Likewise, for arena and HT, if you miss a day, then carry over up to
> half of the battles to the next day. So, if for instance you are not
> buying BP then carry up to 10 battles to the next day. If you are
> buying BP then carry up to 15 battles to next day. If I skip day 1,
> I should be able to do either 30 or 45 battles on day 2 depending if
> I have BP or not. If I actually do 10 battles on the first day then
> I’d still get the remaining 10 (for non-BP) and 15 of the
> remaining 20 (for BP) to the next day. This way you don’t lose
> too much by skipping days. We’ve all had days where we just couldn’t
> log on or didn’t have the 2 hours needed to do all of the missions.
> We are not benefited in any way by this, but we at least don’t get
> hit too hard by skipping a day.
> 
> Apologies for the long suggestion, but I’m trying to gain a few
> precious minutes. I see friends giving up on the game all the time
> even though they like simply because they can’t keep up. It’s
> really exhausting to have to grind for 2 hours a day every day
> and get punished if you miss a day

Thank you very much for your suggestion. This is also a problem we have
been considering recently. We will gradually make the needed improvements
to the amount of time needed to play the game.
