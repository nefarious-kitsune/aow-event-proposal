## Guild - Guild Quests

[Main suggestion](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/930748378122440704)

* When a member contributes to a [guild quest](quests/guild-quests), the member earns points
* Members can use the points to redeem goodies in the [Guild Shop](shop/guild-shop)
* When a member leaves a guild, the player loses all points (the member needs to spend all points before leaving).
