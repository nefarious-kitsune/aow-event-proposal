## Time-Management - Gold Earning Tracking

* Let players track how much gold they earn each day.
* Create a new [Exp Quests](quests/exp-quests) such as "Earn 8M coin"
* The progress should count up even after the quest is completed.

> Farming display improvement...
>
> I would like to see a display of 'base gold' left before cap kicks in.
> Would really help know how far the daily farmers are down the line and
> how much they have to go before hiring the drop /cap.
> 
> Perhaps in a battle report under the gold it could display xxx/6000000
> remaining.. I know it couldn't be exact because of the extra bonuses etc,
> but it would be a good indication.

## Time-Management - Load Reduction

[Main suggestion](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/932554790855118910)

* Reduce gaming time and give players more control over how they spend the time
* Remove daily quests (move gem rewards to [log-in rewards](inbox/inbox)).
* Create **[Exp Quests](quests/exp-quests)** which serves as a *reminder* of things that most players do everyday.

> The game is really cool, fun and interesting ... ..
> However, it takes too much "time" to do daily activities.
> 
> The game should be done in about one hour of the day, and ONLY for
> those who can and wants, another hour, for farming etc.
> 
> Reduce something (leaving the rewards unchanged) so that doing all
> the activities in the game takes less time.
>
> It is becoming too stressful, demanding, and complicated to do all
> the various daily activities.

> Thank you

Create an Assist feature for level 8000. The player can tap on a Support hero icon to choose Green, Edward, Selene, or Seondeok from his barrack, and the field hero can use the chosen support hero’s passive ability.
