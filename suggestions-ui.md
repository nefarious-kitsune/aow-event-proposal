## Show damages at various threshold levels in Ranking UI
[Suggestion by RIP](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/932785870468182017)
> For HH and infinity war, the global rank list is not very helpful.
> You're only showing the first 200 players in a game played by thousands.
> The least you can do is show us the current DMG done by the player at
> each of the thresholds for rewards. 500,1000,2500,etc.

## ❌Access barrack from home page

[Suggestion by AKINCIBEYiᵀᵁᴿᴷ#4697](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/917005807684567090)
> There should be a simple button to access our barracks, heroes and troops from the game home screen.

<blockquote style="color:#b93a35">
Thank you for your suggestion. This kind of adjustment may have great
changes to the interaction and may affect other players and make it
inconvenient for them. Such changes (especially the ones that are done
with the main screen) need to be taken very cautiously. Therefore, we may
not make such adjustments in the short term, but thank you very much for
your concerns and suggestion. We will definitely discuss improving this
part of the game and its UI.
