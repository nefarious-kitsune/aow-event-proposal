## Show damages at various threshold levels in Ranking UI
[Suggestion by RIP](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/932785870468182017)
> For HH and infinity war, the global rank list is not very helpful.
> You're only showing the first 200 players in a game played by thousands.
> The least you can do is show us the current DMG done by the player at
> each of the thresholds for rewards. 500,1000,2500,etc.
