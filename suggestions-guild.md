Thank you for your suggestion, but temporarily we have no plans
to adjust the clan chests. However, we are planning to use other
ways to increase clan rewards to meet players’  needs in resources
and stimulate them to level up their clans.

Your suggestion is really good, we will consider how to implement it in the
game and design more levels for rewards.
