> Hello. A solution for extra resources would be that when the clan advances

> 500 magic dust. In this situation, each member will be more motivated to

Thank you for your suggestion, but temporarily we have no plans
to adjust the clan chests. However, we are planning to use other
ways to increase clan rewards to meet players’  needs in resources
and stimulate them to level up their clans.

> 1. Motivate guild members to contribute to guild quests
> 2. Make it easier for small clans to retain members, and
> 3. make guild quests easier to fullfil:
>
> * When a member contributes to a [guild quest](quests/guild-quests), the member earns points
> * Members can use the points to redeem goodies in the [Guild Shop](shop/guild-shop)
> * When a member leaves a guild, the player loses all points (the member needs to spend all points before leaving).

> Encourage players to do task in clan quests and do the manticore thingy,
> by Incentivizing points that could be earned by doing the tasks, and in
> return, players could use them to buy rewards in clan shop (it may
> consist of gems, shards, dust, medals).
