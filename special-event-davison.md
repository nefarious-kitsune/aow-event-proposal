**[BATTLE]**

----
> It looks like the challenger was way over his head, and he has
> been disqualified.

> More challenges will come. Take a rest.

**REWARD: 50 gems, 10k coins**

### Stage 2 - Reflection

> Although Davison is powerful, a low-level Davison can die quickly
> when he uses his active skill and dives into the enemy, so it's
> best to turn his active skill off.

*Defeat the enemy without using hero skill*

**[BATTLE]**

----

> Davison's might come from his reflection skill.

> To maximize his prowess, a knoweledgable commander would use multi-load troops.
> Can you do it?

*Defeat the enemy with only 9-load troops*

**[BATTLE]**

----
> You showed the might of the dragon!

> It looks like someone did not get it. He is using many mage troops in his
> Davison formation. Show him a lesson.

**[BATTLE]**

----
> That will teach him!

> Tomorrow we will move to another arena. Take a good rest.
