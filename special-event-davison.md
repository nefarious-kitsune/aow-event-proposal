### Stage 1 - Dragon Festival

> Good day, commander. I'm **Kocia**, the organizer of the annual Dragon Festival

> I am looking for a commander who can showcase the power of the mighty Davison.
> **Kit** speaks highly of you, so I am considering you as one of my candidate.
> Are you up to the challenge?
 
**[START]**

----
> Davison can be pretty wild. Show me that you can tame the dragon.

*Defeat the enemy*

**[BATTLE]**

----
> I am impressed.

> But it looks like one of my other candidates isn't. He is challenging
> you to a duel. Prove that you are the better dragon master.

*Defeat the enemy*

**[BATTLE]**

----
> It looks like the challenger was way over his head, and he has
> been disqualified.

> More challenges will come. Take a rest.

**REWARD: 10 gems**

### Stage 2 - Reflection

> Davison's might come from his reflection skill.

> To maximize his prowess, a knoweledgable commander would use multi-load troops.
> Can you do it?

*Defeat the enemy with only 9-load troops*

**[BATTLE]**

----
> You showed the might of the dragon!

> It looks like someone did not get it. He is using many mage troops in his
> Davison formation. Show him a lesson.

*Defeat the enemy*

**[BATTLE]**

----
> That will teach him!

> Tomorrow we will move to another arena. Take a good rest.
