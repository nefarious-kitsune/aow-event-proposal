# Tests of Gods

[The AoW Ideas project](https://github.com/nefarious-kitsune/aow.ideas):
*Ideas from AoW players on changes & improvements to help make the game more interesting.*

## Problem

* The new mode "The Tests of Gods" does not benefit any group of players.
* Players who have not reached level 8000 cannot farm coin quickly enough

## Suggested Solution

Design the new mode to help new and intermediate players.

Make it a permanent game mode which allow players to farm coins
by battling other players' formations *without reaching level 8000*.

Make it so advanced players can skip the game mode (no gem reward)
to reduce loading.

New name and new story line:
> **The Sacrarium of War**
>
> The Sacrarium of War is a sacred place created by the Gods of War
> to test the limit of commanders.
>
> Show the prowess of your military might,
> and you shall be rewarded with loads of gold coins.

To make sure new players can win battles, choose opponents who
1. rank in King or Conquerer rank the previous season, and
2. have never reached God of War rank. 

Make it easy for players to farm in the new mode.
* Use the same 3-star system as level 8000 with same coin multiplier (2× / 1.5× / 1×).
* Stars cannot be collected and used to unlock chests.
* Enable Hohenheim and Jinn's coin bonus
* Allow players to use 2× coin ticket
* Allow players to watch 3× advertisements
* Limit to 100 battles each day
