# Complete Guide to Total Noob

Self intro: I am Kitsune, and I have played AoW:L for almost two years now.
My arena rank is about 1,000. I started this game as an F2P (free-to-play)
player, and I also have several alt accounts, so I have quite some
experience being a *new* player. The is a guide for complete beginners.
Some advices here may be quite subjective.

## 1. Starting out

When you first start the game, you should progress to level 3000 as quickly
as possible so you can unlock most troops and game features. The first
4000 levels are very easy and you should be able to pass them quickly with
a random army formation.

Try to hold off on opening Troops Chests until you pass level 3000 (where
Frost Archers are unlocked). You want to maximize your chance of getting this
highly sought-after troops.

## 2. Your first hero

Your friends or clan mates may suggest that you get Selene, Chione, or Aly.
However, I would suggest not to worry about your primary arena hero at all.

Instead, you should get **Jinn** to level 6 - 8 first. Then,
save all your gems and decide on your arena hero later.

In this game, farming gold coins for troops draw is the hardest and most
important thing. It's far better to have many good troops to support a level 7
hero than to have few good troops and a level 15 hero. Jinn and Hohenheim
can increase coin drops from defeated enemy units in main levels. If you
rely on Hero Chests and Super Cards to get Hohenheim, you could be playing for
months and not have Hohenheim at a decent level. Playing Card Master for Jinn
is a reliable way to improve your gold farming quickly.

## 3. Temple of Fusion

Most players would tell you to save gems for hero, and I used to make that
advice as well. However, to be honest, very few people stick to it religiously.
With my main accounts and all of my alt accounts, I have used Temple of Fusion
before I got the main hero to level 15.

Grinding coin for troops is a long and never-ending process. If you are
struggling mightily and feel fusing troops is the way out, then by all
means visit the Temple of Fusion.
