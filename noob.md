# Complete Guide to Total Noob

Self intro: I am Kitsune, and I have played AoW:L for almost two years now.
My arena rank is about 1,000. I started this game as an F2P (free-to-play)
player, and I also have several alt accounts, so I have quite some
experience being a *new* player. The is a guide for complete beginners.
Some advices here may be quite subjective.

## 1. Starting out

When you first start the game, you should progress to level 3000 as quickly
as possible so you can unlock most troops and game features. The first
4000 levels are very easy and you should be able to pass them quickly with
a random army formation.

Try to hold off on opening Troops Chests until you pass level 3000 (where
Frost Archers are unlocked). You want to maximize your chance of getting this
highly sought-after troops.

## 2. Your first hero

Your friends or clan mates may suggest that you get Selene, Chione, or Aly.
However, I would suggest not to worry about your primary arena hero at all.

Instead, you should get Jinn to level 6 - 8 first, and then save all your gems
and decide on your arena hero much much later.
