# Complete Guide to Total Noob

by Kitsune

I have played Art of War: Legions for almost two years now.
Currently my arena rank hovers at around 1,000.

I started this game as an F2P (free-to-play) player, and I have restarted
playing this game with several alt accounts, so I have some
experience *being a new* player*.

The following is a guide for complete beginners.
Some advices here may be quite subjective.

## 1. Starting out

When you first start the game, you should progress to level 3000 as quickly
as possible so you can unlock most troops and game features. The first
4000 levels are fairly easy and you should be able to pass them quickly with
a random army formation.

Try to hold off on opening Troops Chests until you pass level 3000 (where
Frost Archers are unlocked). You want to maximize your chance of getting this
highly sought-after troops.

## 2. Your first hero

Your friends or clan mates may suggest that you get Selene, Chione, or Aly.
However, I would suggest not to worry about your primary arena hero.

Instead, you should first get **Jinn** to level 6 to 8. After that,
save all your gems and decide on your arena hero later.

In this game, farming gold coins for troops draw is difficult but very
important. You will perform better in arena with many good troops to support
a level 7 hero than you would with few good troops and a level 15 hero.

Jinn and Hohenheim can increase coin drops from defeated enemy units in
main levels. If you
rely on Hero Chests and Super Cards to get Hohenheim, you could be playing for
months and not have Hohenheim at a decent level. Playing Card Master for Jinn
is more reliable way to improve your gold farming quickly.

## 3. Formation Basics

The following are basic formations beginners should work on.

| Arena and Leveling | Honor Hunting | Infinity War |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------ |

## 4. Temple of Fusion

Most players would suggest that beginners should save gems for hero first
and avoid visiting the Temple of Fusion, and I used to make that advice as well.
However, to be honest, very few people stick to the rule religiously.
With any of my main and alt accounts, I have used Temple of Fusion
before I got the main hero to level 15.

Grinding coin for troops is a long and never-ending process. If you are
struggling mightily and feel fusing troops is the way out, then by all
means visit the Temple of Fusion.

Some tips on fusion:
1. Hold off fusing any 9-load troops until you can make a proper Honor Hunting
formation (see #4 Honor Hunting)

2. When you fuse troops, start with the following troops as fusion fodder:
   - Iron Guards, Hell Jailers,
   -
