# Domains and Elements

[The AoW Ideas project](https://github.com/nefarious-kitsune/aow.ideas):
*Ideas from AoW players on changes & improvements to help make the game more interesting.*

[中文版](zh.elements)

## Domains

Change unit grouping from *Races* to *Domains*. "Domain" is a more generic concept than "Race" and are therefore better umbrella for grouping.

For example, Ballista and Goblin Cannons are inanimate objects constructed by humans and wild beings, and are more aptly described as units of Human Domain and Wild Domain.

Change "Dark Race" to "Chaos Domain". There are Supernatural units that are neither from the natural world or the underworld. For example, Meteor Golem should be better described as alien beings belonging to the Chaos Domain.

Change "Racial Synergy" and "Racial Restraint" to "Domain Synergy" and "Domain Restraint".

## Skill Elements

Reclassify attack and defense skills as Skill Elements that occupy specific Domains.

-----

## Tech and Tech Repair

**Tech** is an element controlled by the Human and Wild Domain.

**Tech Repair** is an element controlled by the Human Domain.

|          | Tech          |
| ---------| ------------- |
| Human    | Ballista      |
| Wild     | Goblin Cannon |
| Divine   | n/a           |
| Chaos    | n/a           |

**Suggested change**
- Tech units should have special immunity to Magical attacks.
- Tech units should have special immunity to Control and Binding, but not to Stalling
- Planck should have the ability of Tech Repair
- Rework the ugly Harrison design so he becomes a cyborg.
- Introduce a Crocodilian Cyborg hero that projects metal balls from a prosthetic arm. At level-11 or above, the metal balls would become walking bombs that produces small explosion upon contact with enemy troops.

-----

## Time Travel, Summoning, Revival

**Time Travel** refers to moving animate and inanimate objects **across time**.

**Summoning** refers to moving animate and inanimate objects **across space**.

**Revival** refers to reviving killed units.

Note that these are distinctive concepts, and rules regarding troops revival need to be rewritten (see Edict below)

**Suggested change**
- Introduce a new Sacred hero that can summon troops to the field. For example, when a Human troops died honorably in the battle field (e.g. the troops dealt at least 1000 damage from basic attack before death), **Odin** would ordain the troops into Valhalla, and Odin would be able to summon the troops back into the field once.

-----

## Human Edict and Divine Edict

Rulers in the Human and Divine Domains can impose rules (**Edicts**) on the battle field.

Edicts are rules that cannot be affected by any skill of another hero.

Human Edicts specifically only affect friendly units. For example, a Strategist Hero (such as Zhuge Liang/诸葛亮) would provide buffs to friendly troops according to their positions. 

Divine Edicts specifically only affect enemy units. For example, Horus prevent enemy units from manipulating natural laws of time, space, and life (e.g. no time travel or revival).

**Suggested change**
- Change Horus's skill description so that he prohibits Time Traveling and Troops Summoning by non-Sacred units. The new skill would allow Horus to prohibit the summoning of reflection (Ainz), bats (Dracula), demons (Mephisto), skeletons, and small spiders (Spider Queen), but the Edict would not affect Jinn's Last Wish and Odin's calling troops from Valhalla).
- Introduce new Human heroes that can impose Edicts on friendly troops.

-----

## Armor, Toughen, Aureole, and Curse

Units in the Human Domain can use technology to create **Armor** with special property such as *Energy Absorption and Blast* and *Damage Reflection*. The amor can be worn by units of *all* domains. The armor can also increase sharpness of weaponry and ignores the **Toughen** ability of the Wild Domain. Armor has no effect against **Curse**.

Units in the Wild Domain can harden their skin or protective scales to **Toughen** themselves and greatly increase endurance against both physical and poison attacks. Heroes in the Wild Domain can only toughen *themselves* with Active and Passive skills. However, they may toughen other Wild units with Legendary and Domain Synergy under some circumstances.

Units in the Divine Domain can provide **Aureole** that provide immunity to damage, control, and curse. However, **Aureole** is not effective against Poison attacks from the Wild Domain.

Units in the Chaos domain can **curse** enemy units.

**Counter Relationships**
* Armor > Toughen > Aureole > Curse > Armor

Note: Aureole does not counter Armor

**Suggested change**
- Change Arthur so he provides **armors** which ignores Toughen ability of the Wild Domain.
- Change Selene's skill so that her passive skill allows troops to be immune to all curses (Voodoo Dolls, Dark Witch) and all control effect from the Chaos and Human Domains (e.g. Yasha's stun is ignored, but Aly's stun is not). Reduce Selene's damage immunity to balance the game.
- Change Cactuses skill so that they have fixed physical counter attack instead of Reflection

-----

# Power

**Power** (energy) is a catch-all element for attacks that do not fall into other elements, such as Taurus Witchers' energy balls.

-----

## Stalling, Control, and Binding

**Stalling** refers to delay of skill releases (e.g. Ivan and Harrison's skills) and slow-down of troops (e.g. Ice Mage's skill)

**Binding** refers to interrupting attacks and movements without other special effects.

**Control** refers to interrupting enemy units with special effects, such as stun and taunt.

**Suggested change**
- Change description of Ice Dragon so that the Dragon is vulnerable specifically to Control of Chaos Domain.
- Change skills of Nezha and Selene so that they no longer stun enemy units. For example, when Selene releases skill on Aly, Aly would momentarily stop charging the ball, but Aly would be able to release the ball later. However, the interrupt skill does not force re-targeting (no side effect), so Aly would release the ball at the original target and likely miss.

-----

## Poison

**Poison** is an element that is controlled by the Wild and Chaos domains.

Poison has the special property that it deals *internal* damage that ignore certain immunity.

**Counter Relationships**
* Wild Poison ignores damage immunity of the Divine domain (e.g. ignores Selene's passive skill)
* Chaos Poison ignores damage immunity of the Human domain (e.g. ignores Arthur's passive skill).

**Suggested Changes**

* **Snake Queen** (wild) or Medusa (dark): an __Assassin__ hero who wears pouches of poisonous needles on the waist. She releases the needles onto the enemy and deal both physical and internal damage. The physical damage can be reduced by Armor (Human) and Toughen (Wild) but not Aureole (Divine).
* **Cactuses** - Remove reflection ability. When cactuses receive physical melee attacks, the thorns on the Cactuses deal counter-damage and inject venoms into the attacker's body.
* **Jellyfish** (wild) - Passive troops that uses bioluminescence to attract enemy troops and release venoms when attacked. 
* **Poison Moth** (wild) - Back-attacking units that release poisonous spores while flying to the back of the enemy lines.
* **Shadow Raiders** (dark, 9-load range units) - Fast-moving troops that shoot poisonous darts from dart blowers

-----

## Mimicry

**Mimicry** is an element that is controlled by the Wild domains.

**Suggested Changes**

* **Slim** - When attacked by a troops, the slim turns into a copy of that troops. Cannot be cursed by Voodoo Dolls.
