# Natural Elements

Natural Elements are to be grouped into 3 *pairs* of sub-elements:

## Fire and Light

The two elements are generally associated with power and energy.

**Fire** is the *most* powerful of all elements. Troops with the Fire element has additional **Freezing Resistance** (16 instead of 12) (Note: heroes are not affected). Because Fire produces light, the Chaos Domain cannot control Fire. 

**Light** (including lightening and electricity) is fairly powerful and exclusively controlled by the Divine Domain. Troops with the Light element has additional **Control Resistance**. 

----

## Ice and Shadow

The two elements are generally associated with darkness and chaos.

**Ice** creates the effect of Binding (Freezing).

**Shadow** creates the effect of Disruptive Control (Physical and Psychic)

-----

## Air, Earth, and Water

These elements are *support* elements for the other Natural Elements.

**Air** can *enhance* other elements
- Air can increase attack and/or movement speed of friendly units
- Air can increase damage output of friendly units

**Water** is similar to Air except it is exclusive to Poseidon only

**Earth** can *reduce* other elements
- Earth can reduce attack and/or movement speed of enemy units
- Earth can reduce damage taken by friendly units
