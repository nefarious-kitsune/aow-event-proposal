## Problems with Races

- Racial restraints inevitably lead to questions such as
   - *Why doesn't the Sacred Race have troops with Stun skill?*
   - *Why doesn't the Dark Race have multi-load ranged troops?*
   - *Why doesn't the Wild Race have single-load mage troops?*
- There is no apparent framework governing which kind of troops a Race should have or should not have.
- This can easily lead to many troops and heroes with very similar properties and usages.
- Race is a poor term for inanimate objects such as towers and cannons.
