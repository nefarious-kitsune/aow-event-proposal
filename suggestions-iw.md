# Suggestions on Infinity War

Ideas on game improvement from players of Art of War:Legion.

## 👍Higher level troops doing less damage

[Suggestion by Petrus PT#5302](https://discord.com/channels/658594298983350293/659077000027308104/930070379173675048)
> Fix IW. It is unacceptable that using the same formation with stronger
> troops (for example, by upgrading GTs from level 8 to level 9) results
> in substantially lower total damage. The same formation with stronger
> troops should mean better results, not worse.

> [snip] Either create more groupings or give rewards to the top100 finishers
