# Guild Quests

[The AoW Ideas project](https://github.com/nefarious-kitsune/aow.ideas):
*Ideas from AoW players on changes & improvements to help make the game more interesting.*

## Problem

(1) Many guilds have problem motivating members to contribute to guild quests.

(2) Many small guilds have difficulty retaining recruits.

(3) Some guild quests are very difficult to fulfill.

## Suggested Solution

* Reward guild members when they contribute to fulfilling Guild Quests.
* When a member contributes to a guild quest, the member earns “[silver coins](../shop/silver-coin)”.
* Members can use silver coins to purchase items in the [Guild Shop](../shop/guild-shop) 
* Separate guild quests into 3 types:
   - Arena Offense, e.g. Attack in the Arena with Warrior heroes
   - Arena Defense, e.g. Defend in the Arena with Beast Master
   - Non-Arena, e.g. Acquire 500 Legendary Heroes
* The quest list should have two of each type.
* See [Exp quests](exp-quests)
* See [Guild events](guild-events)

### User Interface

* 3rd Tab in [Guild](../structure/guild) interface
* New chest design for better differentiation
