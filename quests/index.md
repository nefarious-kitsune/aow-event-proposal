# Personal and Clan Quests

A collection of ideas on improving **player experience** on personal and clan quests

## Goals

* Unification of game UI with better planning
* Reduce redundant screen tapping
* Reduce player loads
* Improve clan experience

## UI Unification

Organize Command Center, Clan, and Alliance (future feature) so they
have similar UI.


| Function      | Personal     | Clan      | Alliance  |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------| --------- |
| General       | Profile      | Profile   | Profile   |
| Communication | Inbox        | Chat      | Chat      |
| Quests        | Quests       | Quests    | Titan War |
| Resources     | Achievements | Clan Shop | Gold Mine |
