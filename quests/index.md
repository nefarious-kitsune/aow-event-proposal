# Quests

## Problem

Currently, some daily quests such as "Kill 5000 legendary enemy units" are
very time consuming. Players sometimes get busy in life and could not
complete all quests, and they can feel stressed for not being able to collect
gem rewards.

Quests should be made so that:
* they are not compulsory
* they can be completed quickly

## Suggested Solution

* Remove daily quests (move rewards to [log-in rewards](../rewards/)
* Create Exp Quests that only reward Exp Points and Gold Coins.

## UI Unification

Organize Command Center, Clan, and Alliance (future feature) so they
have similar UI.


| Function      | Personal     | Clan      | Alliance  |
| ------------- | ------------ | ----------| --------- |
| General       | Profile      | Profile   | Profile   |
| Communication | Inbox        | Chat      | Chat      |
| Quests        | Quests       | Quests    | Titan War |
| Resources     | Achievements | Clan Shop | Gold Mine |
