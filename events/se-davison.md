## 1 Dragon Festival

(Intro)

> Good day, commander. I'm **Kocia**,
> the organizer of the annual Dragon Festival

> I am looking for a commander who can showcase the power of
> the mighty Davison.
> **Kit** speaks highly of you, so I am considering you as one
> of my candidate. Are you up to the challenge?

(1.1)

> Davison can be pretty wild. Show me that you can tame the dragon.

(1.2)

> I am impressed.

> But it looks like one of my other candidates isn't. He is challenging
> you to a duel. Prove that you are the better dragon master.

(Outro)

> It looks like the challenger was way over his head, and he has
> been disqualified.

> More challenges will come. Take a rest.

## 2 Reflection

(2.1)

> Although Davison is powerful, a low-level Davison can die quickly
> when he uses his active skill and dives into the enemy, so it's
> best to turn his active skill off.

(2.2)

> Davison's might come from his reflection skill.

> To maximize his prowess, a knowledgeable commander would use
> multi-load troops.

(2.3)

> In battle, ranged troops such as Archers can deal damage to enemy quickly,
> but they must be protected by melee troops.
> 
> Place your Infantry at front and Archers at the back.

(2.3)

> You displayed the might of the dragon!

> It looks like someone did not get it. He is using many mage troops in his
> Davison formation. Give him a lesson.

(Outro)

> That will teach him!

> Tomorrow we will move to another arena. Take a good rest.
